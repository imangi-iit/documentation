# Methodology Followed

## 1. Literature Review and Insights from AI

The first step involved conducting a thorough literature review on the cybersecurity of OT components. This helped in understanding the current state of the domain, identifying key challenges, and gathering insights into potential security issues faced by OT systems. AI-based methodologies and modern threat detection techniques were also explored for integration into the project.

## 2. Collection and Accumulation of Resources

A comprehensive collection of resources was accumulated, including:

- Articles, white papers, and journals on cybersecurity and OT components.
- GitHub repositories with relevant code, tools, and frameworks for OT emulation and cybersecurity.
- Documentation on industrial protocols (OPC UA, Modbus, Siemens S7), Docker containers, and attack simulation techniques.

These resources laid the foundation for the next steps in the project.

## 3. Deciding Upon the Stages of the Project and Components/Infrastructure

### Initial Stage: Understanding OPC UA Communication

- **Protocol Selection**: The project started with **OPC UA** protocol due to its widespread use in industrial environments and its built-in security features.
- **Sample Client-Server Setup**: A sample client-server setup was created using `opc.tcp://localhost:4840` port to understand the basics of OPC-UA and TCP-based communication.
  - A simple, manually coded PLC program was used to test this communication.
  - The focus was on connecting the OPC UA client (a GUI-based software) to the server and visualizing the PLCâ€™s working, including reading and modifying values.

### Docker Containerization

- **Developing Docker Containers**: Docker containers were created to emulate the client and server components. The containers were configured to expose ports `4840` (OPC UA) and `502` (Modbus) for open communication within the network.
- **Custom PLC Program with OpenPLC**: A custom PLC program was developed using OpenPLC Editor. The program contained three variables, one of which was mutable (input), and was then run in the server container.
  - The client container was able to read and modify the values in the server container, allowing further experimentation with scripts for interaction.

### OPC UA Wrapper

- Not natively supported by OpenPLC. The idea was to develop a wrapper around the modbus broadcast by the OpenPLC program.
- The `modbus_to_opcua.py` python script is used to capture the Modbus messages and convert and then broadcast to `opc.tcp://localhost:4840`, so it is visible on the network bridge.
- This is done using two of the libraries: [`pymodbus`](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus) and [`opcua-asyncio`](https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/opcua-asyncio).
- **To explore**: There exist a library which uses OPC-UA in the base itself instead of Modbus [link](https://github.com/andiburger/OpenPLC_v3_Opcua.git) -> Not sure if this is working though.
- This shall be used majorly for the project going forward (having to simulate cyber attacks, etc.), hence more importance (in terms of time and features of the client, server and attacker) has been given to it.
- ! Make this work for an extended number of PLC codes (need to check the breakdown of the message). This _might_ add redundancy if the message does not support or give off the memory location initially itself. Other way would be to get access to the program at the client location and parse it for further use.

<!-- - ! **Doubt**: Can the Modbus stuff be captured, even if the wrapper exists (maybe this can be prevented by not exposing the `502` port reserved for Modbus). -->

- ! **Doubt**: Check why and where was `pymodbus` was used in this case?

### Modbus Implementation

- The OpenPLC program natively works on the Modbus-TCP communication protocol.
- It uses the `502` port (need to expose this while running the Docker container).
- Considered to be the simplest protocol with no inherent security.

### Siemens Wrapper

- Uses the **Siemens S7** communication protocol.
- Utilises the `102` port on the localhost (Remeber to expose this while running the Docker container).
- Used the [python-snap7](https://github.com/gijzelaerr/python-snap7.git) library to get the client code running (this is a simple framework which acts as a wrapper for the snap7 PLC communication library based in `C`).
- Natively supported by OpenPLC (enable in the settings on the webclient, if already not active).
- Utilises the snap7 library at the base, even in the backend for the implementation. [Link to Documentation](/assets/documents/Siemens_Protocol_driver_for_OpenPLC.pdf)
- Needed to create a custom client for recieving the broadcasts. This can not be modular as yet (does have a generalised support for each and every `st` file). For this, one can temporarily either manually update the function - `read_inputs_outputs()` according to each and every memory location.
- Other way is to develop a simple python script that reads the `st` file, and makes the custom `read_inputs_outputs()` code which can be used to update the main function.

## 4. Progressing to Additional Protocols

After successfully implementing OPC UA, the next step was to extend the system to support other protocols:

- **Siemens S7 Protocol**: The same approach was followed for the Siemens S7 protocol, where a custom PLC program was used to emulate the communication between the client and server containers.
- **Modbus Protocol**: Similarly, Modbus protocol was integrated into the system to test communication with additional types of OT devices.

## 5. Development of Attack Simulation

- **Creating Attacker Docker Container**: An attacker container was developed to simulate a cyberattack on the emulated OT components. Initially, the attacker container was set up to sniff network packets between the client and server containers.
  - This initial phase focused on basic packet sniffing to identify communication vulnerabilities.
  - **Advanced Attack Techniques**: Future work will involve a more sophisticated approach to enter the Docker network without leaving traces in the Docker logs. Research on this advanced method will be explored.

## 6. Simulation of MITM Attack

- **MITM Attack Simulation**: A basic MITM attack was simulated by intercepting the communication between the client and server.
  - This was implemented using packet sniffing tools, and future work will enhance this by including more complex attack techniques, such as **IP address spoofing** and modifying the intercepted communication.
  - Other basic ideas include running `arpspoof` with the correct IPs to route the traffic via the attacker container.
  - Once ARP Spoofing is successful, you can observe the TCP communication flowing in (verify via the `tcpdump port 502` command running in another CLI of the same Docker container).
  - After this verification, execute your attack file, which in this case is the `mitm.py` file.

## 7. Future Goals

The future goals for the project include:

- **Advanced Attack Scenarios**: Implementing more nuanced attack types, such as **Ransomware** or **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks, to test the resilience of the system under different types of threats.
- **Attack Evasion Techniques**: Exploring more advanced methods to bypass security measures in Docker containers, potentially integrating **AI-based intrusion detection systems**.
- **Scalability**: Extending the emulation to handle larger industrial networks with multiple devices and communication protocols.
- **Optimization**: Refining the system for better performance, enhancing the speed and efficiency of both emulation and attack simulations.
