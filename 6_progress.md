# Current Progress and Future Goals

## Current Progress

- **System Design**: The architecture for the PLC emulation and cyberattack simulation is complete.
- **Docker Setup**: Docker containers for OPC UA, Modbus, and Siemens S7 protocols have been created.
- **Cyberattack Simulation**: MITM and dictionary attack simulations have been implemented and tested successfully.
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication and encryption mechanisms have been configured for secure communication.

## Future Goals

- **Advanced Attack Scenarios**: Simulating more complex attacks, such as ransomware or denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- **Scalability**: Expanding the emulation to simulate larger industrial networks with more devices.
- **Optimization**: Improving system performance by optimizing container configurations and network settings.
