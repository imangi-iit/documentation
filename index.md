## Introduction 
The basic idea behind the project is to emulate the OT components (devices like PLCs, commuincation protocols like OPC UA, Modbus and Siemens S7) of the FSM Lab (Cyber-Physical Lab) using various Docker containers and to simulate various kinds of cyber attacks that could be conducted on the same. Additionally, since these are OT (operational technology) components, they have their own set of similarities and dissimilarities with the IT (information technology) components. The following document will contain the detailed methodology followed and a few set of links, etc that can help anyone get started with the project.
