# Concepts Applied | Other Generated

## Containerization and Virtualization

- **Docker**: The entire system is virtualized using Docker containers, allowing the simulation of multiple devices (PLCs) and communication protocols in a controlled environment. Containers provide isolation, which is ideal for testing and security purposes.

## OPC UA and Industrial Protocols

- **OPC UA (Unified Architecture)**: A secure and scalable communication protocol widely used in industrial systems. It provides mechanisms for authentication, encryption, and integrity, ensuring secure data exchange.
- **Modbus**: A simple protocol for serial communication in industrial control systems. It is used to simulate interactions between PLCs and connected devices.
- **Siemens S7**: A proprietary industrial protocol for Siemens PLCs, commonly used in automation environments.

## Cybersecurity

- **Cyberattack Simulation**: Various cyberattacks, including MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) and dictionary attacks, are simulated to test the vulnerabilities of OT systems.
- **Encryption and Data Integrity**: Ensures that the communication remains secure from unauthorized access or modification.
